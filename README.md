Transistor Switch: 
-------------------------
**Rochelle De Silva (914561)**

A transistor is utilized as a switch to turn on and off an LED. In this stage of the EOG project, a circuit for the transistor switch is simulated and built for a single LED. 

The aim is to:
- Simulate and build a circuit using a transistor as a switch in both LTSpice & WaveForms
- Turn on and off an LED
