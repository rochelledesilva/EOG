A instrumentation amplifier is utilized to amplify a filtered EOG signal. In this stage of the EOG project, a circuit for the instrumentation amplifier is simulated and built.

The aim is to:
- Simulate and build a circuit using a instrumentation amplifier in both LTSpice & WaveForms
- Test the intrumentation amplifier with a sine wave test signal
- Test the instrumentation amplifier with recorded EOG signal data
- Test the instrumentation amplifier with real time EOG signal data
