# EOG by Rochelle De Silva
Peak Detectors & Comparators
-------------------------
**Rochelle De Silva (914561):**

Positive and negative peak detectors are utilized to detect the positive and negative peaks in an EOG signal. Positive and negative comparators are utilized in outputting a binary number (0 or 1) which corresponds to whether or not a peak is detected - with 0 meaning no peak is detected and 1 meaning a peak is detected. The output then results in an LED switching on (for an output of 1) or an LED switching off (for an output of 0). In this stage of the EOG project, a circuit for the positive and negative peak detectors and comparators is simulated and built.

The aim is to:
- Simulate and build positive and negative peak detector and comparator circuits using a LM324N op-amp and a LM339 in both LTSpice & WaveForms
- Test the peak detectors and comparators with a sine wave test signal
- Test the peak detectors and comparators with recorded EOG signal data
- Test the peak detectors and comparators with real time EOG signal data
- Output an LED display based on eye movement.
